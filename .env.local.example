# Sentry Error Tracking Configuration
#
# To enable Sentry error tracking:
# 1. Copy this file to `.env.local` (it will be ignored by git)
# 2. Create a Sentry project at https://sentry.io
# 3. Copy your DSN from Project Settings > Client Keys (DSN)
# 4. Paste it below
#
# Note: The app will work without Sentry, but errors won't be tracked.
# Separate DSNs recommended for development and production environments.
